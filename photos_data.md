## Detailed Descriptions (30-35 words)

1. **workshop-wood-glue-clamping.jpg** — Bar clamps tightening a wood glue-up on a workbench in the workshop. Glue is dripping from the joint between pieces of light-colored lumber. A hand saw is visible in the foreground.
2. **led-light-panel-wiring.jpg** — RGB LEDs being wired and tested inside a wooden frame with a glass or acrylic top. A Mean Well power supply, breadboard with microcontroller, and wiring harness are visible on the bench.
3. **led-wire-soldering-closeup.jpg** — Close-up of three stripped wires (white, green, red) held in alligator clips on a green soldering surface. The wires are being prepped for soldering LED data and power connections as part of the disco floor build.
4. **disco-floor-grid-led-assembly.jpg** — Full view of the disco floor grid frame from above, painted white, with individual RGB LED modules mounted in each cell using metal strapping. Workshop with parts drawers and tool chest in the background.
5. **disco-floor-lights-hello-world.mov** — Seven-second video of the completed light panel running in a darkened room. Each cell in the grid glows a different color — reds, blues, greens, pinks, teals — with colors shifting and cycling through a test pattern.
