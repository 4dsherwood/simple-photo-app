## Detailed Descriptions (30-35 words)

1. **workshop-wood-glue-clamping.jpg** — Bar clamps tightening a wood glue-up on a workbench in the workshop. Glue is dripping from the joint between pieces of light-colored lumber. A hand saw is visible in the foreground.
2. **disco-floor-partial-assembly.jpg** — Partially assembled disco floor grid frame on workshop floor, painted white. Some cells have RGB LED modules mounted with metal strapping, while others remain empty. Tools, lumber scraps, and a miter saw visible in the background workspace.
3. **unwrapping-acrylic-sheet.jpg** — Seated on the workshop floor, Melinda peels protective paper from a large acrylic sheet. The glossy surface reflects the open framing above, with tools and lumber around, preparing panels for the disco floor.
4. **led-light-panel-wiring.jpg** — RGB LEDs being wired and tested inside a wooden frame with a glass or acrylic top. A Mean Well power supply, breadboard with microcontroller, and wiring harness are visible on the bench.
5. **led-wire-soldering-closeup.jpg** — Close-up of three stripped wires (white, green, red) held in alligator clips on a green soldering surface. The wires are being prepped for soldering LED data and power connections as part of the disco floor build.
6. **disco-floor-grid-led-assembly.jpg** — Full view of the disco floor grid frame from above, painted white, with individual RGB LED modules mounted in each cell using metal strapping. Workshop with parts drawers and tool chest in the background.
7. **disco-floor-lights-hello-world.mov** — Seven-second video of the completed light panel running in a darkened room. Each cell in the grid glows a different color — reds, blues, greens, pinks, teals — with colors shifting and cycling through a test pattern.
