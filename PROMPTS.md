## Tips for Effective Prompts

- **Be specific** about what you want changed or created
- **Reference files** using @ mentions when available
- **Set constraints** (e.g., "ONLY staged changes", "do not stage other files")
- **Ask for strategy first**, then implementation
- **Provide context** when collaborating with others (co-authors, permissions)
